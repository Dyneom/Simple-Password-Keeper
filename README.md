This is a project for storing password on PCs. It was orginaly created by me for me but I thought it was a a good idea to make it public.

⚠️  It may be not secure. If you use this code make sure no breach were found on the Fernet part of the cryptography package.


🏗️ Work in progress

Everything is written in Python so feel free to read and change the code to your liking
